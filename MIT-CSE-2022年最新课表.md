### General Institute Requirements (GIRs)

The General Institute Requirements include a Communication Requirement that is integrated into both the HASS Requirement and the requirements of each major; see details below.

| Summary of Subject Requirements                              | Subjects |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | -------: |
| Science Requirement                                          |        6 |
| Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement [two subjects can be satisfied by [6.3260[J\]](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.3260) and [6.4590[J\]](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.4590) (taken as part of a track) in the Departmental Program]; at least two of these subjects must be designated as communication-intensive (CI-H) to fulfill the Communication Requirement. |        8 |
| Restricted Electives in Science and Technology (REST) Requirement [can be satisfied by [6.1910](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.1910) and [6.1200[J\]](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.1200) (if taken under joint number [18.062[J\]](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=18.062)) in the Department Program] |        2 |
| Laboratory Requirement (12 units) [satisfied by [6.1010](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.1010) in the Departmental Program] |        1 |
| **Total GIR Subjects Required for SB Degree**                |   **17** |



| Physical Education Requirement                               |      |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| Swimming requirement, plus four physical education courses for eight points. |      |



Choose at least two subjects in the major that are designated as communication-intensive (CI-M) to fulfill the Communication Requirement.
